# LV2 – Programming I Assignments

This folder contains assignments from the Programming I course at FERIT (1st year). All assignments are written in C and cover slightly more advanced topics such as arithmetic operations, logical conditions, memory size, scientific notation, and variable swapping.

## Assignments

### Assignment 1  
Enable user input for three real numbers: `x1`, `x2`, and `x3`. Calculate and print the result of:  
`y = x1^2 + 10*x2 - (x3^2 / 2)`  
**Description:** The program calculates a mathematical expression based on user input and prints the result as a float.

### Assignment 2  
Enable user input for one integer and check if it is divisible by 3.  
**Description:** The program prints `1` if the number is divisible by 3, otherwise prints `0`.

### Assignment 3  
Allow the user to input the radius of a circle, then calculate and print its area and circumference with 3 decimal places.  
**Description:** The program computes and displays the area and perimeter of a circle using the provided radius.

### Assignment 4  
Enable user input for real numbers `x` and `α`, and check if `x` is within the interval `[−α, α]`.  
**Description:** The program prints `1` if `x` is inside the interval, otherwise prints `0`.

### Assignment 5  
Print how many bytes are used by the following constants: `1000`, `10.5`, `2F`, and `'A'`.  
**Description:** The program uses `sizeof()` to determine memory size of various types.

### Assignment 6  
Enable user input for one integer and check if it is **odd** and **greater than 20**.  
**Description:** The program prints `1234` if both conditions are met, otherwise prints `0`.

### Assignment 7  
Enable user input for a number of days `x`, and convert that number into years, weeks, and remaining days.  
**Description:** The program calculates how many full years, weeks, and days are in a given number of days.

### Assignment 8  
Enable user input for the lengths of three sides `a`, `b`, and `c`, and check if a triangle can be formed.  
**Description:** The program checks triangle validity using the triangle inequality theorem and prints `1` if valid, else `0`.

### Assignment 9  
Enable user input for two real numbers `a` and `b`, then swap their values using a temporary variable.  
**Description:** The program prints the values before and after swapping.
