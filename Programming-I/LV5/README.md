# C Programming - Projects

This repository contains various C programming projects, each demonstrating different algorithms and concepts. The main goal is to practice and understand fundamental programming principles.

## Task List

1. **Largest and Smallest Number in Array**

   - This program finds the largest and smallest number in a given array of integers.

2. **Average of an Array**

   - This program calculates the average of the elements in a given array of integers.

3. **Sum of Even Numbers**

   - This program calculates the sum of all even numbers in a given array.

4. **Count Positive and Negative Numbers**

   - This program counts how many positive and negative numbers exist in a given array.

5. **Replace Negative Numbers with Zero**

   - This program replaces all negative numbers in an array with zero.

6. **Print Array in Reverse Order**

   - This program prints the elements of an array in reverse order.

7. **Sort Array**

   - This program sorts an array of integers in ascending order using a sorting algorithm.

8. **Compare Two Arrays**

   - This program compares two arrays and checks if they are identical.

9. **Matrix Addition**

   - This program performs matrix addition of two given matrices.

10. **Matrix Transposition**

    - This program transposes a given matrix (converts rows into columns).

11. **Sum of Diagonal Elements**

    - This program calculates the sum of the diagonal elements in a square matrix.

12. **Matrix Multiplication**

    - This program performs matrix multiplication of two given matrices.

13. **Magic Square Check**

    - This program checks if a given matrix is a magic square (all rows, columns, and diagonals have the same sum).

14. **Sum of Elements Above Main Diagonal**

    - This program calculates the sum of the elements above the main diagonal in a square matrix.

15. **Check Symmetry of Matrix**
    - This program checks if a given matrix is symmetric (its transpose is equal to the matrix itself).

## Compilation

To compile and run the programs, you can use `gcc` or any compatible C compiler.

```bash
gcc -o program program.c
./program
```
