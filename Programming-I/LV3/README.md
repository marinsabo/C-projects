# LV3 – Programming I Assignments

This folder contains assignments from the Programming I course at FERIT (1st year). All assignments are written in C and cover a range of fundamental topics including loops, conditions, user input validation, mathematical operations, and basic algorithmic problems.

## Assignments

### Assignment 1  
Enable user input for an integer `n` within the range `[5, 25]`. For every number from `1` to `n`, print that many stars (`*`) on a new line.  
**Description:** The program uses nested loops to print a pattern of stars based on the user’s input.

### Assignment 2  
Allow the user to input grades represented by letters from `A` to `F` (uppercase or lowercase) and count how many grades from `A` to `F` were entered. Stop when the user enters an exclamation mark (`!`).  
**Description:** The program uses a `switch` statement to process grade inputs and count the valid grades until the user terminates with `!`.

### Assignment 3  
Allow the user to input a natural number and print its digits separated by double underscores (`__`), starting from the last digit to the first.  
**Description:** The program extracts the digits of a number and prints them in reverse order, separated by `__`.

### Assignment 4  
Allow the user to input ten integers and calculate the percentage of even numbers among them.  
**Description:** The program counts how many even numbers were entered and calculates the percentage of even numbers.

### Assignment 5  
Allow the user to input three characters and determine which character has the smallest ASCII value. For the other two characters, print the difference between their ASCII values and the smallest one in hexadecimal.  
**Description:** The program compares the ASCII values of the entered characters and prints the differences for the other characters in hexadecimal format.

### Assignment 6  
Allow the user to input an integer and check whether it is a prime number.  
**Description:** The program determines if a number is prime by checking if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

### Assignment 7  
Allow the user to input an integer and print all of its positive divisors.  
**Description:** The program finds and prints all divisors of the given number.

### Assignment 8  
Allow the user to input the lengths of three sides of a triangle and determine if a valid triangle can be formed. If so, print its type (equilateral, isosceles, or scalene).  
**Description:** The program checks the validity of a triangle based on the triangle inequality theorem and prints its type.

### Assignment 9  
Print all three-digit numbers whose last digit is divisible by 3. Additionally, calculate and print the arithmetic mean of these numbers.  
**Description:** The program identifies numbers based on a specific condition and calculates the arithmetic mean of the matching numbers.

### Assignment 10  
Allow the user to input characters one at a time until the character `q` is entered. Count and display how many characters were input before `q`.  
**Description:** The program counts the number of characters entered before `q` and prints the count.

### Assignment 11  
Allow the user to input ten real numbers and determine the minimum and maximum values among them.  
**Description:** The program finds the smallest and largest values in a list of ten real numbers.

### Assignment 12  
Allow the user to input the number of points scored from laboratory exercises (between 0 and 28), then calculate and display the percentage of the overall grade that comes from these exercises (20% of the grade).  
**Description:** The program calculates and displays the contribution of laboratory exercise points to the overall grade percentage.

### Assignment 13  
Allow the user to input an integer `n > 2` and find the number within the range `[1, n]` that has the most divisors. Print this number along with the number of divisors.  
**Description:** The program identifies the number in the given range with the most divisors.

### Assignment 14  
Allow the user to input five real numbers, ensuring that each number is in the range `[-100, 50)`. Find and display the largest number entered.  
**Description:** The program ensures that each number is within the given range and determines the largest number among the valid inputs.

### Assignment 15  
Allow the user to input an integer `n > 100` and print all prime numbers in the range `[2, n]`.  
**Description:** The program prints all prime numbers in the specified range using a basic primality test.
