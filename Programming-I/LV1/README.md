# LV1 â€“ Programming I Assignments

This folder contains assignments from the **Programming I** course at **FERIT** (1st year). All assignments are written in **C** and cover basic programming concepts: input/output, data types, number systems, and working with different data types.

## Assignments

1. **Assignment 2**  
   Enable user input for one integer and one floating-point number, and print them in the format:  
   "The first number is x, and the second is y".

   - **Description**: The program takes an integer and a floating-point number as input and prints them with the floating-point number having 2 decimal places.

2. **Assignment 3**  
   Allow the user to input an integer and display its value in decimal, octal, and hexadecimal formats.

   - **Description**: The program takes an integer and prints its value in three different number systems.

3. **Assignment 4**  
   Declare and initialize three variables of different types, one of which must be of type `char`. Print their values.

   - **Description**: The program initializes three different types of variables and prints their values.

4. **Assignment 5**  
   Allow the user to input two characters and print them in reverse order along with their ASCII values in decimal, octal, and hexadecimal formats.

   - **Description**: The program takes two characters as input, prints them in reverse order, and displays their ASCII values in decimal, octal, and hexadecimal formats.

5. **Assignment 6**  
   Allow the user to input values for a `short int` and a `double`, and print them.

   - **Description**: The program takes one `short int` and one `double` as input and prints their values.

6. **Assignment 7**  
   Allow the user to input a floating-point number and print it in scientific notation.

   - **Description**: The program takes a floating-point number as input and prints it in scientific notation.

7. **Assignment 8**  
   Declare two floating-point variables and print their values in scientific notation.

   - **Description**: The program declares two floating-point variables and prints their values in scientific notation.

8. **Assignment 9**  
   Allow the user to input a floating-point number in scientific notation and print it.

   - **Description**: The program takes a floating-point number in scientific notation and prints it in decimal format.

9. **Assignment 10**  
   Declare and initialize two `char` variables and print their values.

   - **Description**: The program declares two `char` variables and prints their values.
